# YOLOv5 Object Detection - COCO Dataset

This repository contains an implementation of object detection using the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) model, which has been custom-trained on the COCO dataset using PyTorch. The model can detect objects in both images and video streams. It can also output the confidence score and bounding boxes for detected objects.

## Features

- **YOLOv5 Object Detection**: Trained model for detecting objects from the COCO dataset.
- **Image and Video Support**: Detect objects in both static images and video files.
- **Bounding Box & Confidence**: Provides bounding boxes and confidence scores for each detected object.
